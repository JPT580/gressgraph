Description
===========

doesn't make sense yet.)

I welcome your comments and suggestions.

You can find the latest version of this software at <http://jekor.com/gressgraph/>.

Requirements
============
* Graphviz
* iptables

If compiling from source:
* GHC     (>= 6.8.2)
* lhs2TeX (>= 1.11)
* GNU Make

Usage
=====

$ iptables -L -vx | gressgraph > iptables.twopi
$ twopi -Tsvg iptables.twopi > iptables.svg

See gressgraph.pdf for more detailed documentation, including a description of
the program source. If you cannot create a gressgraph.pdf file (with make doc),
you can download it from <http://jekor.com/gressgraph/gressgraph.pdf>.

Note: There are no commandline options. Also, I've only tested the program
on my own simple iptables ruleset. It's likely that it will fail to parse your
rules.

If you want gressgraph to support your ruleset, send me the output of
iptables -L -vx on your machine.

Building
========

$ make
$ make test

If you didn't receive gressgraph.pdf:

$ make doc

Manifest
========
gressgraph.lhs       - the literate Haskell source to the program
test-iptables-output - example iptables output (used for testing the program)
Makefile             - a GNU makefile for building the components
COPYING              - the text to the GNU GPLv3

Troubleshooting
===============
* The program hangs after outputting "// Interfaces".

gressgraph is waiting for input. Make sure you've sent it something on its
stdin (it does not take a file as a commandline argument).

Modifications/Source
====================
You can checkout the latest source with:

$ darcs http://jekor.com/gressgraph/

I'd be happy to consider any changes you send me.
